<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mining Gas Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Type</li><li>Portable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mining gas detectors are essential tools for ensuring the safety of miners in hazardous environments. The two main types of mining gas detectors are stationary type and portable type. Stationary gas detectors are fixed in place and continuously monitor the surrounding area for gas leaks, providing early warning of potential dangers. Portable gas detectors, on the other hand, are handheld devices that allow miners to carry out spot checks in different locations. Both types play a crucial role in preventing gas-related accidents in the mining industry.</p></p>
