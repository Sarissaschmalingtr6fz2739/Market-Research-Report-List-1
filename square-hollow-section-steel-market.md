<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Square Hollow Section Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WeldedSHS</li><li>SeamlessSHS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Square Hollow Section (SHS) steel market can be classified into two main types: Welded SHS and Seamless SHS. Welded SHS involves manufacturing by welding steel coils together to form the square shape, while Seamless SHS is made by extruding a solid steel billet through a die to create the square section without any welding. Welded SHS is more commonly used due to its cost-effectiveness, while Seamless SHS is preferred for applications requiring high precision and strength. Both types cater to different market demands and applications in the construction and engineering industries.</p></p>
