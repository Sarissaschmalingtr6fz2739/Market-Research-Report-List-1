<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Feed Mycotoxin Modifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic</li><li>Organic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Feed mycotoxin modifiers are divided into two main types - inorganic and organic. Inorganic mycotoxin modifiers are chemical substances that bind to mycotoxins in the feed, preventing their absorption by the animal's body. Organic mycotoxin modifiers, on the other hand, are natural substances derived from plants or microorganisms that detoxify mycotoxins without causing harm to the animal. Both types of mycotoxin modifiers are used in the feed industry to minimize the negative effects of mycotoxins on animal health and performance.</p></p>
