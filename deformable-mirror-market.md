<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deformable Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Segmented Mirrors</li><li>Continuous Surface Mirrors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Deformable mirrors in the market are classified into two main types: Segmented mirrors and continuous surface mirrors. Segmented mirrors are made up of multiple individual mirror segments that can be adjusted independently to correct distortions in the reflected image. On the other hand, continuous surface mirrors have a single, uniform reflective surface that can be deformed as a whole to achieve the desired optical correction. Both types of deformable mirrors have unique applications and are used in various industries such as astronomy, laser optics, and adaptive optics systems.</p></p>
