<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Digital Mass Flow Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Type</li><li>Pressure Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor digital mass flow controllers are available in two main types: thermal and pressure. Thermal mass flow controllers measure the flow rate by using a heated sensor to measure the amount of heat carried away by the fluid passing through the sensor. Pressure mass flow controllers, on the other hand, measure the flow rate by monitoring the pressure drop across a restriction in the flow path. Both types have their own advantages and applications in semiconductor industry for precise control of gas flow rates.</p></p>
