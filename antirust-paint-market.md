<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antirust Paint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Antirust Paint</li><li>Chemical Antirust Paint</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antirust paint market can be categorized into two main types: physical antirust paint and chemical antirust paint. Physical antirust paint works by forming a protective barrier between the metal surface and the environment, preventing rust formation. Chemical antirust paint, on the other hand, contains corrosion inhibitors that actively react with the metal surface to prevent rusting. Both types of antirust paint are effective in protecting metal surfaces from corrosion, but they work in slightly different ways to achieve this goal.</p></p>
