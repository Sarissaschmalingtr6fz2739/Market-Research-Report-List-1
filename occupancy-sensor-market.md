<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Occupancy Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PIR (passive infrared) Sensors</li><li>Ultrasonic Sensors</li><li>Dual-technology Occupancy Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Occupancy sensor market consists of three main types: PIR sensors, Ultrasonic sensors, and Dual-technology occupancy sensors. PIR sensors detect movement by measuring infrared radiation emitted by objects within their field of view. Ultrasonic sensors emit high-frequency sound waves to detect motion and occupancy in a space. Dual-technology sensors combine both PIR and ultrasonic technologies to provide more accurate and reliable occupancy detection. Each type of sensor has its own advantages and disadvantages, making them suitable for different applications in buildings and homes.</p></p>
