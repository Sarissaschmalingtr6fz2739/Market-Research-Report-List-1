<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lightweight Synthetic Acrylic Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lightweight synthetic acrylic fibers are commonly produced using two main methods: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving acrylic polymer in a solvent and extruding it into a coagulation bath to form fibers. This process offers better control over fiber properties such as size and shape. Dry spinning, on the other hand, involves dissolving the polymer in a solvent and spinning it into a heated chamber where the solvent evaporates, leaving behind the fibers. Dry spinning is often used to produce high-quality, fine fibers for a variety of applications.</p></p>
