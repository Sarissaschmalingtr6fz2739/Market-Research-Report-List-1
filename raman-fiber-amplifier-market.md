<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Raman Fiber Amplifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lumped</li><li>Distributed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Raman Fiber Amplifier market can be classified into two types - Lumped and Distributed. In Lumped Raman amplifiers, the pump light is injected into the fiber at spaced intervals, causing localized amplification. This type of amplifier is simpler and more cost-effective but has limited power handling capability. On the other hand, Distributed Raman amplifiers use continuous pumping along the entire length of the fiber, resulting in a more uniform amplification process. Although more complex and expensive, distributed amplifiers provide higher power outputs and better performance over longer distances.</p></p>
