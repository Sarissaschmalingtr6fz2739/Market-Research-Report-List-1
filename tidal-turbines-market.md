<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tidal Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tidal turbines are devices used to generate electricity from the movement of tides in oceans and seas. There are two main types of tidal turbines - Horizontal Axis Turbines and Vertical Axis Turbines. Horizontal Axis Turbines have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, similar to traditional wind turbines. Vertical Axis Turbines have blades that rotate around a vertical axis, allowing them to capture energy from tides flowing in any direction. Both types of turbines are used in the emerging market for tidal energy generation.</p></p>
