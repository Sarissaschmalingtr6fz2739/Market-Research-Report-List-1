<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Tracker for Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis</li><li>Dual Axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single Axis Solar Trackers are mounting systems that allow solar panels to move on one axis, typically following the sun from east to west throughout the day. This increases energy generation by optimizing the angle of the panels to capture more sunlight. Dual Axis Solar Trackers, on the other hand, can move along two axes, both horizontally and vertically, allowing for even more precise alignment with the sun's position. While single axis trackers are more common due to their lower cost, dual axis trackers offer even higher energy production potential.</p></p>
