<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Clutch Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Push-Type Clutch Bearing</li><li>Pull-Type Clutch Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the Automotive Clutch Bearing market, there are two main types: Push-Type Clutch Bearing and Pull-Type Clutch Bearing. Push-Type Clutch Bearing is designed to push the pressure plate away from the clutch disc, disengaging the clutch when the pedal is depressed. On the other hand, Pull-Type Clutch Bearing pulls the pressure plate towards the clutch disc to disengage the clutch. Both types play a crucial role in the smooth operation of the clutch system in vehicles, ensuring efficient power transfer between the engine and transmission.</p></p>
