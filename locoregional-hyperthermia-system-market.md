<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Locoregional Hyperthermia System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Heat Delivery System</li><li>Internal Heat Delivery System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Locoregional hyperthermia systems refer to devices used to deliver controlled heat therapy to localized areas of the body. There are two main types of locoregional hyperthermia systems: External Heat Delivery Systems, which apply heat from outside the body, and Internal Heat Delivery Systems, which deliver heat directly to the targeted area internally. External systems are often used for superficial tumors, while internal systems are more effective for deep-seated tumors. Both types of systems aim to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatment through the application of heat.</p></p>
