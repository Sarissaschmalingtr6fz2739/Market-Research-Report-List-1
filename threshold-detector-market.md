<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Threshold Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fixed threshold detectors have a pre-set threshold level that cannot be adjusted by the user. This type is often used in applications where a specific threshold value is required for consistent performance. On the other hand, adjustable threshold detectors allow the user to manually adjust the threshold level according to the specific requirements of the application. This flexibility makes them suitable for a wider range of applications where the threshold may need to be changed or fine-tuned over time. Both types offer unique advantages depending on the specific needs of the user.</p></p>
