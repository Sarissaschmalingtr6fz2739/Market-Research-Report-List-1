<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Pigtail Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Unshielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copper pigtail cables are available in two main market types: shielded and unshielded. Shielded pigtail cables are encased in a protective layer that reduces electromagnetic interference and crosstalk, making them ideal for use in environments with high levels of electrical noise. Unshielded pigtail cables, on the other hand, do not have this protective layer and are more cost-effective but may be more susceptible to interference. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
